A [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) CAD drawing of a Centuri logo.

Centuri was a video arcade game manufacturer which produced both original and licensed arcade machines in the 1980's. The company eventually became insolvant and discontinued operations.

As an arcade enthusiast, I wanted to build a reproduction Centuri Track & Field cocktail cabinet. Real cabinets had a metal Centuri logo on the coin door. Unfortunately, nobody made these sorts of reproductions.

Consequently, I took it upon myself to create my own, and that is the content contained within this repository.

With the help of the owners of authentic Centuri machines, I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (vector graphics software) to generate an SVG rendering, which I then imported into [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) (CAD software). I was then able to convert the rendering into a 3d image and have it 3d printed and finally milled from a billet of aluminum or some other suitable metal or alloy.

I want the rest of the arcade community to benefit from my efforts, so I'm open-sourcing my work and placing it here.

I believe the measurements to be accurate, but my rendering is designed to fit into my Wells Gardner "pinball style" coin door, which I acquired from [Twisted Quarter](http://www.twistedquarter.com).

Let it be known, that these designs still need tweaking for my purposes, but at the request of the community, I'm placing the drawings as they currently stand in this repository. My hope is that others will contribute and refine the design.

Because I am unable to obtain permission of the owner of Centuri or information on the status of Centuri's trademarks, I have not placed any license on this repository out of fear of legal retribution. While I generated and maintain these files, I have no claim to the rights of the logo they represent. There is not (nor should there be) any monetary gains to be made by utilizing these works. These files are intended to be used for restorations, reproductions and hobbiest activities.

I only ask that you credit me in your efforts by linking to this repository, or my Classic Arcade Project blog where and how _you_ think it makes sense to do so.
