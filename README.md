# Reproduction Centuri Logo

## TLDR;
A [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) CAD model of a Centuri logo along with the SVGs used to create the CAD model.

## About
Centuri was a video arcade game manufacturer which produced both original and licensed arcade machines in the 1980's. The company eventually became insolvant and discontinued operations.

As an arcade enthusiast, I wanted to build a reproduction Centuri Track & Field cocktail cabinet. Real cabinets had a metal Centuri logo on the coin door. Unfortunately, nobody made these sorts of reproductions.

Consequently, I took it upon myself to create my own, and that is the content contained within this repository.

With the help of the owners of authentic Centuri machines, I used [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/) (vector graphics software) to generate an SVG rendering, which I then imported layer-by-layer into [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) (CAD software). I was then able to convert the rendering into a 3d image and have it 3d printed and finally milled from a billet of aluminum or some other suitable metal or alloy.

I want the rest of the arcade community to benefit from my efforts, so I'm open-sourcing my work and placing it here.

Let it be known, that these designs should be very close to finalized, but at the request of the community, I'm placing the drawings as-is in this repository. My hope is that others will contribute and refine the design.

## Files
There should be everything here you need to create your own file. There is an SVG which contains all of the to-scale layers you need to work with. There are also individual files for each layer. I found it easier to import these layers into Fusion 360 and work with them one layer at a time rather than all at once. Finally, there are two f3d files which are my current CAD rendering of the original logo. One matches the factory original size, and the other is scaled to fit into a Wells Gardner coin door.

## Credits, Copyrights and Trademarks
Because I am unable to obtain permission of the owner of Centuri or information on the status of Centuri's trademarks, I have not placed any license on this repository out of fear of legal retribution. While I generated and maintain these files, I have no claim to the rights of the logo they represent. There is not (nor should there be) any monetary gains to be made by utilizing these works. These files are intended to be used for restorations, reproductions and hobbiest activities.

I only ask that you credit me in your efforts by linking to this repository, or my Classic Arcade Project blog where and how _you_ think it makes sense to do so.
